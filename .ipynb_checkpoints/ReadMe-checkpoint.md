# Not So 2020 Vision
The goal of this project was to get our feet wet with machine learning. Here we take a stab at predicting how a county will vote in the 2020 presidential election, using past presidential election results. We explore a host of demographic, health, and socioeconomic features of nearly every county in the US. We look at a multiple linear regression model and a Xgboost decision tree model. From here we parameter tuned each model to determine which was the best fit. We also aim to visualize the model using a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) python module to see what factors affected the output of our model. Finally we built a tableau public visualization to explore what our model says about the 2020 election.

# Prerequisites
This project uses the following technologies: Tableau, Jupyter labs, and a host of python modules (Xgboost, scikitlearn, SHAP, numpy, pandas, matplotlib). The tableau public visualization can be seen at https://public.tableau.com/profile/will.belcher#!/vizhome/County-levelvotingoutcomes_final/Viewall?publish=yes.
